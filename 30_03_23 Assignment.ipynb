    "Elastic Net Regression is a type of linear regression that combines the penalties of both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization methods to improve prediction accuracy and feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Elastic Net Regression, the objective function is modified to include both L1 and L2 penalty terms. The L1 penalty encourages sparsity in the feature selection by setting some coefficients to zero, while the L2 penalty shrinks the coefficient values towards zero. By combining both penalties, Elastic Net Regression can handle high-dimensional data and can effectively select relevant features while avoiding overfitting."

    "##### Advantages of Elastic Net Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "It can handle high-dimensional data and can effectively select relevant features while avoiding overfitting.\n",

    "It can handle multicollinearity among the predictors by shrinking the correlated coefficients together.\n",

    "It can produce more stable and reliable models compared to Lasso or Ridge Regression alone, especially when the dataset has a high degree of correlation between predictors.\n",

    "##### Disadvantages of Elastic Net Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "It may not be the best choice when the number of observations is much smaller than the number of predictors or when the predictors have a weak signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be difficult to interpret the coefficients of the model, especially when a large number of predictors are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of hyperparameters (alpha and l1_ratio) can be challenging, and cross-validation may be required to find the optimal values.\n",
