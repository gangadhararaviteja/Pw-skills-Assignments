For example, human height and weight, IQ scores, blood pressure, and many other physical and biological attributes are often distributed normally.\n",

    "- It simplifies statistical analysis: Many statistical techniques, such as hypothesis testing and confidence intervals, assume that the data follow a normal distribution. If the data are not normally distributed, the results of these tests may be incorrect. Therefore, it is important to check if the data follow a normal distribution before applying these techniques.\n",

    "- It allows for easy comparison of data: Since the normal distribution is well-defined, it is easy to compare data that follow this distribution. For example, if we know that the mean and standard deviation of a particular attribute are normal, we can easily compare different groups or populations based on this attribute.\n",
