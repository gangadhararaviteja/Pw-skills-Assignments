For example, a study may seek to investigate the relationship between the number of hours a person studies for an exam (independent variable) and the exam score (dependent variable).

    "Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm that is commonly used in machine learning to find the optimal values of the parameters of a model that minimize the error between the predicted and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of gradient descent is to start with an initial set of parameter values, and then iteratively update these values in the direction of the steepest descent of the cost function (i.e., the function that measures the difference between the predicted and actual values). This is done by computing the gradient of the cost function with respect to each parameter, which gives the direction of the steepest ascent of the function, and then moving in the opposite direction.\n",
    "\n",

    "There are two main types of gradient descent: batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent. Batch gradient descent computes the gradient of the cost function for the entire dataset, while stochastic gradient descent computes the gradient for a randomly selected subset of the data (i.e., a mini-batch). Stochastic gradient descent is generally faster and more computationally efficient, especially for large datasets, but may be less stable than batch gradient descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent is used in many machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks. In these algorithms, the cost function is typically a measure of the difference between the predicted and actual values, and the goal is to minimize this difference by adjusting the values of the parameters. Gradient descent is an efficient and widely used optimization algorithm for finding the optimal values of the parameters in these models."
