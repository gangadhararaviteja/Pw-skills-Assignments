    "1. Regularization: Regularization is a technique used to reduce the complexity of a model by adding a penalty term to the loss function. This penalty term encourages the model to have smaller weights, which can reduce overfitting.\n",

    "Detecting overfitting and underfitting is critical in machine learning as it helps to ensure that models are generalizing well to new, unseen data. Here are some common methods for detecting overfitting and underfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Visual Inspection: Visual inspection of the training and validation curves can often reveal whether a model is overfitting or underfitting. If the training loss is decreasing while the validation loss is increasing, the model is likely overfitting. On the other hand, if both the training and validation losses are high, the model is likely underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Cross-Validation: Cross-validation is a powerful technique for detecting overfitting and underfitting. By splitting the data into multiple subsets and training the model on different subsets, we can evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. If the model performs well on both the training and validation sets, it is likely neither overfitting nor underfitting. If the model performs well on the training set but poorly on the validation set, it is likely overfitting. If the model performs poorly on both the training and validation sets, it is likely underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Learning Curves: Learning curves plot the training and validation loss as a function of the number of training examples. If the model is overfitting, the training loss will continue to decrease with more data, while the validation loss will plateau or increase. If the model is underfitting, both the training and validation losses will remain high, indicating that the model is not capturing the underlying patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Test Set Evaluation: Finally, to determine whether a model is overfitting or underfitting, it is important to evaluate its performance on a held-out test set. If the model performs well on the test set, it is likely neither overfitting nor underfitting. If the model performs poorly on the test set, it is likely either overfitting or underfitting."
