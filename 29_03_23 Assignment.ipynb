    "Lasso Regression is a type of linear regression that uses L1 regularization to penalize coefficients of the model. In other words, it adds a penalty term to the cost function that forces some of the coefficients to be zero, effectively performing feature selection and shrinking the coefficients of less important features towards zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is different from other regression techniques, such as Ridge Regression, which uses L2 regularization to penalize the sum of squared coefficients. Ridge Regression can shrink the coefficients towards zero, but it cannot set them exactly to zero, which means it does not perform feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression is especially useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets where there are many features, some of which may not be relevant for the prediction task. By setting the coefficients of these irrelevant features to zero, Lasso Regression can reduce the complexity of the model and improve its generalization performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of Lasso Regression is its interpretability, as it can identify the most important features for the prediction task. In contrast, other techniques such as Support Vector Machines or Neural Networks can be more difficult to interpret"

By reducing the number of features, Lasso Regression can improve the generalization performance of the model and prevent overfitting.\n",

    "In a Lasso Regression model, the coefficients represent the impact of each feature on the outcome variable while taking into account the regularization parameter. The coefficients can be positive, negative, or zero depending on the relationship between the feature and the outcome variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpretation of the coefficients in Lasso Regression is similar to that in linear regression, with the exception that some coefficients may be set to zero due to the L1 regularization. The coefficients that are set to zero indicate that the corresponding features are not important for the prediction task, and thus they can be removed from the model without significantly affecting its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the coefficients is also important in Lasso Regression. Larger coefficients indicate that the corresponding feature has a stronger impact on the outcome variable, while smaller coefficients indicate a weaker impact. However, it is important to note that the size of the coefficients can be affected by the regularization parameter, which determines the trade-off between model complexity and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the interpretation of the coefficients in Lasso Regression involves considering both their sign and magnitude, as well as the regularization parameter, to understand the impact of each feature on the outcome variable and to make informed decisions based on the model's output."

    "Regularization parameter (alpha):\n",
    "The regularization parameter (alpha) determines the strength of the penalty term applied to the coefficients in the model. A larger value of alpha increases the penalty on the coefficients, resulting in more coefficients being set to zero and thus reducing the complexity of the model. On the other hand, a smaller value of alpha reduces the penalty on the coefficients, resulting in more non-zero coefficients and a more complex model. Adjusting the regularization parameter can help to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.\n",

A higher degree allows the model to capture more complex relationships between the features and the outcome variable, but it also increases the risk of overfitting. Therefore, the degree of polynomial features should be chosen carefully to balance the model's complexity and performance."

The degree of the polynomial terms can be adjusted to find the optimal balance between model complexity and performance.\n",

    "Ridge Regression uses the L2 norm of the coefficient vector as the penalty term in the regularization term, while Lasso Regression uses the L1 norm of the coefficient vector.

This process is repeated for different values of lambda, and the value of lambda that produces the lowest validation error is selected as the optimal value.\n",
